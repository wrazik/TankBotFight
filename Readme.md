# How to run
To compile the project you should have compiler that supports C++20 & cmake.
You have to remember about two things: 
- Graphical files are stored in git-lfs
- Package manager is stored as github submodule
- Dependencies are installed via vcpkg


## Downloading the repo

So, before you start, you must first download checkout git-lfs (https://git-lfs.github.com/)
```bash
> git lfs install
> git lfs pull
```
In case you already run `git lfs install` before cloning the repo, `pull` is not needed

To download submodules, run:
```bash
> git submodule init
> git submodule update
```

Next step is to install all dependencies with vcpkg

## Install dependencies with package manager

### Linux & MacOS
```bash
  ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
  ./vcpkg/vcpkg install
```
### Windows

```bash
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg\vcpkg install
```

## CMake generation
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Contributing
We need help! If you have time & want to help - take a look at "Issues". 

Please keep in mind that:
- All PRs should contain tests. 
- To format the code, please use clang-format (configuration file is attached to the repo)
- Naming convention must be kept consistent:
  - class/struct/enum names: PascalCase 
  - class members: mCamelCase 
  - class methods: snake_case 
  - free functions: snake_case 
  - function parameters: snake_case 
  - local variables: snake_case 
  - global constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
